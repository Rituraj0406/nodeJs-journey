Problem Statement:
    You need to create a simple Express.js application with different routes that handle HTTP requests. The server should:

        1. Handle requests to the /users route and display a custom message.
        2. Handle requests to the root route (/) and display a separate message.
        3. Log messages to the console when each route is accessed.


**This Express.js app demonstrates basic routing and response handling, with different output for the /users route and any other route.
