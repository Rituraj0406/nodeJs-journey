In this Node jS and Express application we learned how to share data across the request and user.
We have used template engine like Pug and implemented templates using pug engine and passed the data dynamically and created a layout where we are writing main-layout file which is getting render for commonly used layout in every .pug file.

Here we have seen and learned the function app.render() from Express which helps us to render the template engine in our Express application.

Note:- Pug works on Express Js its in-build you just need to install the pug using "npm install --save pug".
